    "# Ivy Plus MARC Analysis with Enhanced Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook processes MARC data from Ivy Plus libraries to identify unique records held by Penn that are not held by other institutions in the consortium.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enhanced Normalization and Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "The matching process has been improved with specialized normalization for different fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ISBN/LCCN Matching**: When standard identifiers are available, they are normalized and used as primary match keys\n",
    "   - ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 are properly normalized to ensure consistent matching\n",
    "   - LCCNs are standardized to handle different formats and prefixes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Match Key Creation**: For records without standard identifiers, a composite key is created from:\n",
    "   - Normalized title (with improved noise word removal)\n",
    "   - Normalized edition statement\n",
    "   - Normalized publication information with year extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Match Key Validation**: Each match key is validated for quality to detect potential issues\n",
    "   - Short or generic match keys are flagged\n",
    "   - Match key quality metrics are saved for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Field Selection**: \n",
    "   - Leader (FLDR) is now included for record type identification\n",
    "   - Core bibliographic fields (F001, F010, F020, F245, F250, F260) are used\n",
    "\n",
    "This improved approach maintains the principle that different editions, printings, and formats are unique bibliographic entities while enhancing the accuracy of matching across cataloging variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial load only - Institution-specific Processing\n",
    "Converts MARC to Parquet format for faster processing, maintaining institution-specific separation. This step ensures that each institution's MARC files are converted to separate Parquet files for consistent downstream processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion includes the leader field (FLDR) for each record while excluding the 007 field to optimize the output files. The leader contains important information about the record structure, material type, and bibliographic level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HIGH MEMORY REQUIREMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook is configured for a high-performance server environment with the following specifications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **240GB driver memory allocation** (requires ~300GB total system RAM)\n",
    "- **16 cores** for parallel processing\n",
    "- Optimized for a **Linode 300GB server**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running this notebook with the current configuration on a standard laptop or desktop will likely cause your kernel to crash or your system to become unresponsive.**\n"
